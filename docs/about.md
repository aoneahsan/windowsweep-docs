# The windowsweep team

The windowsweep team makes the command-line tool and the [desktop app](./desktop.md), which drives the same engine and reimplements none of it. Both programs are open source under the MIT licence.

No guessed paths. A path becomes a target only once it has been seen on a real machine holding only regenerable data, and the ones still waiting are in the [candidate table](./sections.md#candidate-targets-awaiting-verification). Steam's shader cache is one of them, because the build machine has Steam and no games.

## The cleanup family

| Platform | Tool | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | [linux-cleanup](https://github.com/aoneahsan/linux-cleanup) | `npx linux-cleanup` |
| macOS | [macleanup](https://github.com/aoneahsan/macleanup) | `npx macleanup` |
| Windows | [windowsweep](https://github.com/aoneahsan/windowsweep) | `npx windowsweep` |

All three share the same stance: name every path before touching it, prune files idle for 100 days by default, refuse to enter personal folders, and ship a real dry-run. None of the three makes a network call unless you ask one to check for an update.

## Supporting the work

If windowsweep reclaimed space for you, the two things that help most are a star on GitHub and a note to a colleague who has the same problem. You can also support the maintenance at [aoneahsan.com/payment](https://aoneahsan.com/payment?project-id=windowsweep&project-identifier=windowsweep).
