# Changelog

All notable changes to `windowsweep` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Self-test: ten more checks cover the argument parser, section lists, docker size text, the layout-guard leaf
  test, the `--json` shape, superseded versions, the Chromium layout, workspace storage, stale artefacts and
  the report exporters (124 checks). `Test-KnownCacheLeaf` and `Get-JsonSummary` were split out of
  `Invoke-TargetList` and `Write-JsonSummary` so the logic can be exercised directly; no behaviour changed.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- **Sections 17, 18 and 19 no longer pre-select every item under `--yes`.** In the walkthrough and the menu
  with auto-yes on, section 17 could remove every listed build artefact without a person choosing one, and
  18/19 pre-selected everything before their final question. The selection prompt now appears even with
  `--yes`, defaults to none, and section 17's final confirmation is never auto-answered. Batch mode already
  refused these sections and is unchanged. (RW-002)
- Section 19's title no longer names Desktop; only Downloads is scanned. (RW-003)
- Sections 18 and 19 report the tier `recycle` instead of `permanent` in `--list`. (RW-004)
- `--purge-all` from a console asks you to type `purge` once per run, as documented; `--yes` remains the
  confirmation in batch runs. (RW-005)
- A running editor's VSIX download cache is cleared as documented: it is its own target without the
  running-editor guard. (RW-006)
- `--install-task` and `--install-alias` refuse to run under `npx` (exit 3) and print the global-install
  steps; the npx cache is evicted and the task or alias would break later. (RW-007)
- The engine exits 130 when a run is interrupted before it finished; previously only the Node launcher
  did. (RW-008)
- `--uninstall-data` always asks; `--yes` no longer removes your history unattended. (RW-010)

### Changed

- Internal rename `Write-Log` -> `Write-LogLine` (18 call sites) so PSScriptAnalyzer's
  `PSAvoidOverwritingBuiltInCmdlets` passes under PowerShell 7 in CI. No behaviour change.
- Self-test: four new checks prove the `--yes` asymmetry at the helper and at the section 17/18/19 call sites,
  and that every picker call in `modules/` carries `-NoAutoYes` (114 checks).
- Keywords trimmed to twelve (`temp-files` dropped). (RW-011)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-03

First release. The Windows member of the cleanup family beside
[linux-cleanup](https://github.com/aoneahsan/linux-cleanup) and
[macleanup](https://github.com/aoneahsan/macleanup).

### Added

- **22 numbered sections** (0-21): package-manager caches, build-tool caches, test-runner browsers, Android
  emulators, Docker, editor caches, browser caches, desktop-app caches, Windows user caches, user temp, Recycle
  Bin, Windows Update cache, the Disk Cleanup engine, DISM component-store cleanup, the hibernation file, event
  logs, stale project build artefacts, partial downloads, large stale personal files, disk-image compaction and
  a disk-usage report. Section numbers are a public contract from this release on.
- **Developer mode.** The first interactive run asks whether you are a developer. Yes means package, build and
  test-runner caches are pruned only when idle 100+ days and the newest version of every versioned tool cache
  is kept; no means those caches are cleared completely. The answer is saved and can be re-asked with
  `--forget-developer`.
- **A dry-run that writes nothing** (`--dry-run`), a read-only scan (`--scan`) and `--list-targets`.
- **One deletion chokepoint** that refuses drive roots, Windows, Program Files, the profile root, personal
  folders, credentials, toolchains and browser/editor state, asserts every deletion lies inside its declared
  target root, never follows junctions or symlinks, handles paths longer than 260 characters and skips files
  another program has open.
- **Batch policy.** `--all` runs the safe batch only; deep sections (11, 15, 16, 20) need
  `--i-understand-deep`; personal sections (17, 18, 19) never run unattended and use the Recycle Bin.
- **Admin awareness.** Admin sections skip with the exact command when not elevated; `--elevate` relaunches
  through a UAC prompt.
- **Session reports** as schema-versioned JSON with Markdown and HTML export, a reports manager, run history
  (`--stats`), history pruning and `--json` for scripting.
- **Weekly Scheduled Task** (`--install-task`) and a PowerShell profile alias (`--install-alias`).
- **Self-test** (`--self-test`): script syntax, ASCII-only source, the protection lists, a real junction
  fixture, the dry-run guarantee, keep-newest, long paths and the extension-leftover rule.
- **Crash bundles** written locally on unexpected exit; `--debug-bundle` and `--report-issue` for bug reports.
  Nothing is ever transmitted.
- Node launcher for `npx windowsweep`, a `.cmd` launcher for machines without Node, and a `ci` workflow that
  runs the self-test and a dry-run on both Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.
