# Quick start

Four commands: prove the guards, look, rehearse, then reclaim. Nothing is deleted until the fourth.

## 1. Prove the guards on this machine

```powershell
npx windowsweep --self-test
```

The self-test parses every script and checks that every path any section declares lies outside the protected
paths. It runs fixtures with a real junction. They prove that links are never followed, that `--dry-run` changes
nothing in the tree it rehearses, and that `--yes` never selects a personal or project item. It ends with a pass
count and exits non-zero on any failure.

## 2. See what is there

```powershell
npx windowsweep --scan
```

It deletes nothing. It writes this run's log and one JSON report under `%USERPROFILE%\.windowsweep`, and
touches nothing else; add `--no-report` to skip the report. What it prints: a health report (drives,
hibernation file, disk images, running apps that block cache steps), every target with its size on disk, and
the personal-file scanners' findings.

## 3. Rehearse the run

```powershell
npx windowsweep --dry-run --all --yes
```

Runs the safe batch exactly as a real run would, printing `[dry-run] would ...` lines and an estimate per
section, and writes a JSON report you can export. A non-interactive run defaults to developer mode on; pass
`--not-developer` if that is wrong for the machine.

## 4. Reclaim

```powershell
npx windowsweep
```

The guided walkthrough. On the first run it asks whether you are a developer (see [Developer
mode](./developer-mode.md)), shows a pre-scan, then visits each section: `a` run, `s` skip, `q` quit. **Enter
runs the section** - `a` is the default at that prompt. Every section names what it removes before it acts and
keeps a running total. The summary at the
end lists the log, the report and the follow-up commands (admin sections, browsers that were open).

Unattended alternative, for a Scheduled Task or a script:

```powershell
npx windowsweep --all --yes
```

## 5. The admin step

Sections 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 20 change things only an administrator may change. The `system` profile covers
12, 13 and 14:

```powershell
npx windowsweep --profile system --yes --elevate
```

The other three are deep sections, and the profile leaves them out: 15 is the hibernation file, 16 is the event
logs and permanent, 20 stops Docker and WSL. A batch run refuses a deep section without `--i-understand-deep`.
Name the ones you want with `--only`. Details and the hibernation decision: [Admin sections and
elevation](./admin-and-elevation.md).
