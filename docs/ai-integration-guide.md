# AI integration guide

This is the contract an automated caller can rely on: what windowsweep promises, what it refuses, what it
prints, and what it returns. It is written for an agent or a script rather than a person. For what the tool
*is*, read the [README](https://github.com/aoneahsan/windowsweep#readme); for what each section touches, read
[Sections 0-25](https://github.com/aoneahsan/windowsweep/blob/main/docs/sections.md).

**windowsweep deletes files.** Every command below that is not marked read-only can remove data. There is no
undo for caches. Treat a real run as an irreversible operation and preview it first.

## The safe sequence

```powershell
npx windowsweep --self-test --no-color --no-report     # read-only: proves the guards on this machine
npx windowsweep --scan --no-color --no-report          # read-only: every target and its size
npx windowsweep --dry-run --all --yes --no-color       # writes nothing; reports what a real run would remove
npx windowsweep --all --yes --no-color                 # the real safe batch
```

Add `--json` when a program reads the result. In that mode **stdout carries exactly one line, the JSON
summary**, and every human-readable line goes to stderr. `--json` also implies `--quiet`.

## What `--yes` covers, and what it never covers

`--yes` auto-confirms **regenerable caches only**: sections 0-3, 5-10, 21, and 12-13 when the console is
already elevated.

| Never covered by `--yes` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Sections 17, 18, 19, 23 | The selection prompt appears even with `--yes` and defaults to none. With no console attached nothing is selected, and each asks a final question `--yes` does not answer. Only `--select` / `--select-file` supply a choice (see below) |
| Sections 11, 15, 16, 20 | Deep. Refused in batch mode unless `--i-understand-deep` is also passed |
| `--uninstall-data` | Always asks; `--yes` does not answer it |
| `--purge-all` | From a console it asks for a typed `purge` once per run. In a batch run `--yes` is the confirmation |

In batch mode (`--all`, `--only`, `--profile`) sections 17, 18, 19 and 23 are refused outright and reported as
`refused`, unless a `--select` or `--select-file` choice was supplied. They need a person choosing items -
in advance is fine, absent is not.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | A section failed, or the self-test found a failure |
| 2 | Usage error, or an interactive mode was started without a console |
| 3 | A section named in `--only` was refused, or an installer was started from `npx` |
| 130 | Interrupted before the run finished (Ctrl-C) |

## Flags that matter to automation

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--json` | One JSON line on stdout; everything else on stderr. Implies `--quiet` |
| `--no-color`, `--ascii` | Disable colour and Unicode glyphs. Both are automatic when output is redirected |
| `--no-report` | Skip the JSON report file; the session log is still written |
| `--cleanup-logs` | Delete this run's log at exit; reports are kept |
| `--quiet` | Fewer informational lines |
| `--only L`, `--profile NAME`, `--exclude L` | Choose sections: `--only 1,3,5-7`; profiles `dev`, `minimal`, `cache-only`, `system`, `deep`, `audit` |
| `--days N`, `--temp-days N` | Idle windows, default 100 and 3 |
| `--developer`, `--not-developer` | Override the saved developer answer for this run |
| `--scan-roots "P1;P2"`, `--exclude-path P` | Section 17 roots and exclusions |
| `--logs-dir P`, `--reports-dir P` | Redirect this run's output |
| `--select L`, `--select-file P` | Supply an interactive section's selection in advance, by index or by full path. The only way sections 17/18/19/23 run unattended |
| `--notify` | A Windows notification when the run ends. Never changes the exit code, never writes to stdout |
| `--list --json` | Print the section catalogue as one JSON line instead of the human table |
| `--pwsh` | Launcher only: run the engine on PowerShell 7 |

A non-interactive run with no saved developer answer defaults to developer mode **on**, the conservative
choice, and says so.

## The `--json` line

```json
{"tool":"windowsweep","version":"1.1.0","mode":"all","dry_run":false,"elevated":false,"developer":true,
 "freed_bytes":0,"estimated_bytes":0,
 "sections":[{"section":1,"status":"ran","freed_bytes":0}],
 "candidates":[],"targets":[],
 "refusals":[],"excluded":[],"log_file":"...","report_file":"..."}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `tool`, `version` | Always `windowsweep` and the running version |
| `mode` | `all`, `only`, `scan`, `walkthrough`, `menu`, ... |
| `dry_run`, `elevated` | The two booleans that change what a run does |
| `developer` | `true`, `false`, or `null` in a mode that never resolves the question (`--scan`, `--list`) |
| `freed_bytes` | Real bytes removed. `0` in a dry-run |
| `estimated_bytes` | What a dry-run says a real run would remove. `0` in a real run |
| `sections[]` | One entry per section attempted: `section`, `status`, `freed_bytes` |
| `candidates[]` | What an interactive section offered: `section`, `index`, `path`, `bytes`, `idle_days`, `project`. Always present, empty when none were collected |
| `targets[]` | Scan mode only: `section`, `label`, `path`, `bytes`, `newest_write_utc`. Always present, empty otherwise |
| `refusals[]` | Human-readable reasons a section was refused in batch mode, plus one `excluded: <path>` line per honoured `--exclude-path` |
| `excluded[]` | Every path an exclusion actually kept, listed once each. Empty means "nothing was excluded", never "not reported" |
| `log_file`, `report_file` | Absolute paths, or `null` under `--no-report` |

`status` is one of `ran`, `dry-run`, `skipped`, `refused`, `failed`.

`newest_write_utc` is ISO 8601 UTC (`2026-09-08T13:14:15Z`) - the newest of write, access and creation time
found anywhere under that target, which is the same rule the idle gate uses. It is **`null`** when the
target is absent or holds no files, rather than a zero date a caller would sort as if it were real. It is
emitted only under `--json`, because computing it needs the file walk that `--json` already performs.

## Where output lands

| Item | Path |
|---|---|
| Session logs | `%USERPROFILE%\.windowsweep\logs\` |
| JSON reports and exports | `%USERPROFILE%\.windowsweep\reports\` |
| Debug and crash bundles | `%USERPROFILE%\.windowsweep\feedback\` |
| Settings | `%USERPROFILE%\.windowsweep\config.json` |

Override the root with `WINDOWSWEEP_HOME`, or the two folders with `--logs-dir` / `--reports-dir`
(`WINDOWSWEEP_LOG_DIR` / `WINDOWSWEEP_REPORTS_DIR`). `WINDOWSWEEP_NO_COLOR`, `NO_COLOR` and
`WINDOWSWEEP_ASCII` are honoured; `WINDOWSWEEP_SHELL=pwsh` selects PowerShell 7 through the Node launcher.

The report file is schema-versioned JSON (`schema_version: 1`) with five top-level blocks: `credits`, `meta`
(times, host, OS, PowerShell version, mode, the three flags, the idle windows, the launcher), `disk`
(`before` and `after` snapshots per fixed drive), `steps` (one row per section with `status` and
`freed_bytes`), and `totals`. `--export md|html|both [N|latest|all]` renders any report to Markdown or a
self-contained HTML page without extra tools.

## Elevation

Sections 12-16 and 20 need Administrator rights. Without them the runner skips each with the exact command
to run. `--elevate` relaunches the whole run through a UAC prompt: **a new elevated window opens with its own
log and report**, and the original process waits and returns the child's exit code. That prompt cannot be
answered by a script, so `--elevate` does not belong in an unattended context.

## Guarantees

- - **No network calls of its own**. Self-test check [9] greps every source file for `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Invoke-RestMethod`, `Net.WebClient`, `HttpClient`, `Sockets.TcpClient`, `curl.exe` and `wget`, and fails the run if it finds one. There is no telemetry and no update check. `--report-issue` and `--feedback` hand a URL to the user's browser after they confirm, and neither belongs in an unattended run.
- - **Every deletion of anything on the user's machine passes one chokepoint** with a declared root, and is refused if it falls outside it. windowsweep's own logs, reports and fixtures are the exception, reachable only through `--cleanup-logs`, `--prune-history` and `--uninstall-data`.
- - **Protected paths are refused regardless of flags**: every drive root, fifteen declared roots (Windows, System32, SysWOW64, both Program Files folders, ProgramData, `C:\Users` with Default and Public, the profile root, and the AppData Roaming, Local and LocalLow folders), 66 protected subtrees, 50 path patterns and 13 file names. Two paths are declared exceptions - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\.temp` and `.downloadIntermediates` - and there are no others. No flag bypasses any of it.
- **Junctions and symlinks are removed as links, never followed.**
- **`--dry-run` and `--scan` write nothing** but the log and the report.
- **Section numbers are a public contract.** 0-25 today; a section may be retired as a no-op, and a number is
  never reused. Read `--list --json` rather than hard-coding the set.
- **Zero runtime dependencies.** The package is PowerShell plus a Node launcher that uses only built-in
  modules.

## Do not

- Do not run `npx windowsweep` from a directory that contains a checkout of this repository: npx resolves the
  local package and the command fails. Run it from anywhere else.
- Do not schedule `npx windowsweep` as a task action. The npx cache is evicted and the task breaks; install
  globally and use `--install-task`, which refuses under npx for this reason.
- Do not pipe `y` into the tool to force a personal section. Sections 17, 18, 19 and 23 are interactive by
  design and a piped answer selects nothing - pass `--select` or `--select-file` instead, which is the
  supported way and names exactly what goes.
- Do not treat a green `--dry-run` as proof that a real run frees the same amount: an app that is open at run
  time keeps its caches.

## Driving the interactive sections (1.1.0+)

Sections 17, 18, 19 and 23 refuse to run unattended, because they delete things a person should choose. Two
flags supply that choice in advance, and either one lifts the refusal:

```powershell
# 1. list what the section would offer - deletes nothing
npx windowsweep --only 17 --dry-run --json --no-color
#    -> read .candidates[] from the single stdout line:
#       { "section": 17, "index": 1, "path": "...", "bytes": 0, "idle_days": 400, "project": "..." }

# 2. act on exactly the ones you chose
npx windowsweep --only 17 --select 1,3            # by index, one list per prompt, in prompt order
npx windowsweep --only 17 --select-file picks.txt # by full path, one per line, UTF-8, # comments allowed
```

Rules a caller can rely on:

- **`--yes` alone still selects nothing.** It never has. Only `--select` / `--select-file` do.
- The scripted selection also answers that section's final confirmation, so the run does not stall.
- `--select` is repeatable and consumed one list per prompt; `--select-file` is offered to every prompt, so
  a line that matches nothing in a given section is reported once and skipped.
- Neither flag reaches a path the deletion chokepoint would otherwise refuse.

## Reading the catalogue and following progress

```powershell
npx windowsweep --list --json
```

One stdout line: `sections[]` (`id`, `key`, `title`, `tier`, `admin`, `batch`, `dev`), `safe_batch`,
`safe_batch_admin`, `profiles`, `walkthrough`, `walkthrough_admin`. Read it instead of hard-coding section
numbers - they are frozen, but the set grows.

In `--json` mode every section brackets itself on **stderr**:

```text
##windowsweep section=7 event=start
##windowsweep section=7 event=end status=ran freed_bytes=4096
```

`status` is one of `ran`, `dry-run`, `skipped`, `refused`, `failed`. Scan mode also fills `targets[]`
(`section`, `label`, `path`, `bytes`, `newest_write_utc`) in the final JSON line. `candidates` and `targets`
are always present, empty when nothing was collected.

## The read-only audits

`--profile audit` runs sections 0, 21, 22, 24 and 25 and deletes nothing in any mode: the health report, disk
usage, globally installed packages, installed programs not modified for `--days`+ days, and startup items.
Sections 22, 24 and 25 print removal commands but never execute one, and section 25 never changes a startup
entry. Section 24 reports "not modified", not "not used" - Windows keeps no reliable last-launched record.
